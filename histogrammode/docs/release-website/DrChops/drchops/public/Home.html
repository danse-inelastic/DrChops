<p>
Data Reduction for Chopper Spectrometers (DRCS or DrChops)
is an open-source software to reduce data from 
direct-geometry time-of-flight neutron chopper spectrometers.
It is a product of the 
<a href="http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/projects/danse/release/index.html">
DANSE
</a> project.

DrChops reduction software consists of a string of reduction
components, each of which has a test suite to ensure its validity.
There are also many functions and classes supporting those components.
Most of them are accompanied by test suites.
-->
As an example, 
the figure on the right contains two DOS curves reduced with Dr Chops 
for VPt at room
temperature, measured at two different neutron
chopper spectrometers, LRMECS and Pharos, respectively. 
The agreement between two curves is amazingly good, and
that shows
the reliability of the reduction procedure.

DrChops provides simple GUIs for some reduction applications.
Those GUIs basically present parameters needed for reduction
in a hierarchial way and let users to navigate through 
those configurable items and configure them.

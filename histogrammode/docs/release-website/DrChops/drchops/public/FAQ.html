Q: When I use HistogramGUIApp.py to open a PHAROS dataset (Menu Tools-->Raw data-->Load Histogram from Pharos Experimental Run), no picture shows up in the box.
A: When Pharos data is loaded, the histogram got loaded into
Histogram GUI is I(det, pix, tof), which is 3-dimensional. 
For now, the Histogram GUI
cannot plot a 3D histogram. You will need to project the data
to 2D or 1D to see a plot. For example, you can get a detector-pixel
map of intensity by projecting the 3D I(det, pix, tof) histogram 
along time-of-flight axis: Idp = Idpt.sum("tof").

Q: Doesn't Python make the software run slower?
A:
Yes, but the amount can be imperceptible. We have made every effort to 
design the software so that intensive computations were written in C++, 
and given Python bindings. McStas simulations have been benchmarked as 
both compiled C code and as scripted applications running under the 
pyre framework. The difference in performance was less than 1%. Python 
gives the flexibility to quickly iterate through a variety of 
instrument or sample simulations, for example, and avoids compiler 
issues at runtime.


Q: Can I use the software on a computer running MSWindows?
A:
Yes, there are currently three ways that you can run on a Windows platform.
There are Windows binaries available for download for the current
official release.  Alternately, if you have a C compiler, you can build from
the source tarball.  A third possibility is to use cygwin, and install from the
source tarball (or the ARCS repository) using pyre's native build system
(config).


Q: Why I get an error "Cannot import Channel"?
A: This error happens on Windows or Mac OS X platforms, and only if
you (or some software you have installed) set the environment
variable PYTHONCASEOK. When PYTHONCASEOK is set, python is
case-insensitive, and this will result in imports of wrong
python modules, and hence exceptions. 
The solution is to remove that environment variable. 


Q:Why I get an error "missing msvc71p.dll"?
A:
The ARCS software windows release is compiled using
Microsoft Visual Studio 7.1. It requires 
<a href="http://strongbad.cacr.caltech.edu/arcs-1.0/msvcp71.dll">msvcp71.dll</a>
 to run. 
Usually it
is available on any Windows XP box recently
installed.

=Reduction=
Reduction applications provide tools to reduce experimental data to S(Q,E). 
Currently PHAROS reduction is our main focus because PHAROS is very similar 
to ARCS, our ultimate goal. 
Working on PHAROS reduction will help us understand the challenges of 
reduction software, especially for direct geometry time-of-flight 
instruments like ARCS. Hopefully PHAROS reduction applications will 
be useful to users of PHAROS. Reduciton of data from LRMECS instrument 
at IPNS is also supported.

==GUI==
Graphical user interfaces are available for reduction applications. 
Reduction GUIs consist of dialogs for users to change settings of 
a reduction task and run the reduction. 
The basic procedure of using a reduction GUI is

# Configure. In this step you select output directory, input data files, etc etc
# Run the application
# Exit

After reduction, some reduced data are saved in the output directory, 
and they can be futhered manipulated using 
[[ HistogramViewer-tutorial | Histogram GUI]].

===Front panel===
[[reductionGuiFrontPanel| Front panel]] is a thin GUI application 
that is only useful to launch other reduction GUIs like PHAROS reduction 
GUI or LRMECS reduction GUI.

===Pharos===
PHAROS reduction GUI is a Graphical User Interface to the PHAROS 
reduction application. 
It reduces PHAROS data to S(Q,E), and it can also generate mslice 
data files if you want.

This [[How to run Pharos reduction GUI|tutorial]] walk you through 
a typical PHAROS reduction session.

More details can be found in the [[PharosReductionLight-manual| manual]]

===Lrmecs===
LRMECS reduction GUI is a Graphical User Interface to the LRMEcS 
reduction application.
 It reduces LRMECS data to S(Q,E), and it can also generate 
mslice data files if you want.

This [[How to run Lrmecs reduction GUI|tutorial]] walk you through a typical 
LRMECS reduction session.

More details can be found in the [[LrmecsReductionLight-manual| manual]]

===Histogram===
[[ HistogramViewer-tutorial | Hiistogram GUI]] is a Graphical User Interface to manipulate histograms created in the reduction procedure. Reduction GUIs for PHAROS and LRMECS will save reduced data in files like spehist.pkl (S(phi,E)) and sqehist.pkl (S(Q,E)). Those files can be loaded in the histogram GUI for further manipulations.

==Command line==

Reduction applications can also be accessed from command line. It is useful for more advanced users. For example, one can run a series of reduction runs only changing one input parameter. It is hard to do that with a GUI, but rather easy with a unix command line.

Pharos reduction applications involve one major application, PharosReductionLight.py, and some other tools. PharosReductionLight is the main application to accept user inputs of reduction parameters, and process the Pharos data to obtain meaningful physical quatities like S(Q,E). 


Some user inputs (reduction parameters) of this application can be easily figured out. For example, the guess of the neutron incident energy should be known. But some other user inputs might be difficult to guess without some help. 


PharosPlotI_tof.py is one of the helper applications. It plots integrate intensity vs tof channels. This is useful to determine tof channels corresponding to "time independent background".


PharosReductionLight.py can be run parallely too. It makes use of mpi functionality provided by pyre framework.

=Simulation=
The usage pattern of Simulation applications is different from that of reduction ones. Reduction package consists of a few applications for each instrument and their usage is easy and natural for normal users without knowledge of programming. Simulation package is more "advanced" in the sense of requrement on the user side, at least for now. The key in simulation is the simulation of [[Sample_simulation_framework|sample]], and it requires customization on the user side with good knowledge of pyre components. This complexity will be removed when a GUI is available to help user construct composite components. For now, we will present tutorials to help users to integrate simulation application by hand.

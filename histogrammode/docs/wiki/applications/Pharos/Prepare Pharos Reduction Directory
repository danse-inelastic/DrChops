'''This page explains how to prepare a directory for PHAROS reduction. 
'''

----

'''Hint''':<pre>All data files must be in hdf5 format. The original data files from PHAROS are usually hdf4 files.
Hdf4 files can be converted to hdf5 files by h4toh5 tools, which
can be downloaded from  ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/h4toh5/.
This tutorial uses example data files that are included in the distribution. 
Those example data files are already in hdf5 format.
</pre>



----

=== make a work directory ===

 $ mkdir -p ~/reduction/Pharos
 $ cd ~/reduction/Pharos

=== link to sample data directory ===

If you have not done so, please download [http://strongbad.cacr.caltech.edu/arcs-1.0/ARCS-reduction-data-1.0.tar.gz ARCS reduction sample data] and then extract it somewhere (I will assume that it is ~/reduction):

 $ cd ~/reduction
 $ tar xvfz /path/to/ARCS-reduction-data-1.0.tar.gz

In the extracted "ARCS-reduction-data" directory, there should be subdirectory "Pharos". Let us make a link to that directory here under ~/reduction

 $ cd ~/reduction/Pharos
 $ ln -s ~/reduction/ARCS-reduction-data/Pharos sampledata

this will create a link in ~/reduction/Pharos named sampledata, pointing to the sample data directory for PHAROS.

=== extract data files ===
 $ cd ~/reduction/Pharos/sampledata
 $ gunzip *.gz

=== link to PHAROS instrument definition file ===

 $ cd ~/reduction/Pharos
 $ ln -s sampledata/PharosDefinitions.txt

this will  create a link in ~/reduction/Pharos named PharosDefinitions.txt, which contains information about positions and orientations of PHAROS detector tubes.

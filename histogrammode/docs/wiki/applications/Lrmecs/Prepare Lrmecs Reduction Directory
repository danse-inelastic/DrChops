'''This page explains how to prepare a directory for LRMECS reduction. 
'''

----

====Data format====
All LRMECS data files to be reduced must be in a special ascii format. The original data files from Lrmecs can be converted using command lrmecs2ascii
This tutorial uses example data files that are included in the distribution. 
Those example data files are already in ascii format.

To convert lrmecs data file to ascii format, please do the following:

 $ lrmecs2ascii <original_datafile_name>   >   <destinatio_filename>
 
An example would be:

 $ lrmecs2ascii 4849.run > 4849


====Work Directory====
First we want to create a work directory where we put data files and output files. 

 $ mkdir -p ~/reduction/Lrmecs

Next we want to have access to sample data. 

If you have not done so, please download [http://strongbad.cacr.caltech.edu/arcs-1.0/ARCS-reduction-data-1.0.tar.gz sample data] and put it under directory
 ~/reduction
and expand the tar ball:
 $ cd ~/reduction
 $ tar xvfz ARCS-reduction-data-1.0.tar.gz
This will create a directory "ins-data" which contains sample data files.

Let us make a link to sample data directory

 $ cd ~/reduction/Lrmecs
 $ ln -s ~/reduction/ARCS-reduction-data/Lrmecs sampledata

this will create a link in ~/reduction/Lrmecs named sampledata, pointing to the LRMECS sample data directory.


=== copy Lrmecs sample data files ===
copy the file here
 $ cd ~/reduction/Lrmecs
 $ cp sampledata/4849 .
'''Hint: '''Don't miss the small 'dot' at the end of the last command!

Do the same thing for data files 4844 and 4779

Before you run tests in this directory, please do

  rsh n01 mpdboot -n 1 -f mpd.hosts

to start mpi on upgrayedd.danse.us

The above instruction only works for the cluster "upgrayedd".

To run these tests on other clusters, one will need to

 * make sure you have installed mpi
 * make sure pythia mpi is compiled
 * make sure you have a mpd.hosts
 * make sure you can run sth like
    rsh n01 mpdboot -n 1 -f mpd.hosts
 * make sure mpd is started
    rsh n01 mpdtrace
 * you will need to change the command in Fullreduction_TestCase.py
   that runs the parallel application. It looks like

   rsh -. n01 "PharosReductionApp_Parallel.py -launcher.nodelist=1 -launcher.nodegen='n%02d:4' -launcher.nodes=4 "

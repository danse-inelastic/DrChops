In order to construct a reliable test suite for pyre components of reduction package,
we need to prepare 

 - an instrument
 - a geometer
 - a measurement

It is helpful that they are simple and the data can be intuitively "reduced" by hand
or just in mind.

This proposal tries to address this issue by creating fake instrument, geometer, and
measurement.

========== FakeInstrument ==========
Fake instrument should have a full hierarchy of detector arrays, but easy to 
understand to human mind. 

As a proposal, I would like to make detectors to be circles so that each pixel
in a detector has the exactly same scattering angle. So we can easily "reduce"
data in our mind.

========== FakeGeometer ==========
For powder reduction, only "scattering angle" and "distance to sample" are needed.
So we only need to implement these two methods


========== FakeMeasurement =========
A measurement with simple data. Maybe there should be several of them.

The first one I can think of is to fill the dataset with constant number.
